# Refactoring / Replace Variable With Query

Hey there! We're [thoughtbot](https://thoughtbot.com), a design and
development consultancy that brings your digital product ideas to life.
We also love to share what we learn.

This coding exercise comes from [Upcase](https://thoughtbot.com/upcase),
the online learning platform we run. It's part of the
[Refactoring](https://thoughtbot.com/upcase/refactoring) course and is just one small sample of all
the great material available on Upcase, so be sure to visit and check out the rest.

## Exercise Intro

Within the `total` method of the `Tipper` class, you'll be replacing variables with query methods.

While extracting variables can make longer expressions cleaner, it occasionally leads to longer methods as well. Turning these variables into methods not only simplifies your code, but encourages reuse of these new methods.

## Instructions

To start, you'll want to clone and run the setup script for the repo

    git clone git@github.com:thoughtbot-upcase-exercises/replace-variable-with-query.git
    cd replace-variable-with-query
    bin/setup

Redefine your variables as query methods.

Make sure the tests are still passing by running:

    rake
